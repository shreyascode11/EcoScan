**EcoScan** is a real-time, gamified community waste management platform. Citizens report local waste spots on an interactive map; volunteers claim and clean them up. Every submission is automatically verified by an AI vision model before points are awarded. A second AI pipeline cross-checks the reported GPS location against Google Maps Street View to detect fraudulent or misplaced reports.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

EcoScan uses a decoupled client-server architecture with real-time WebSocket synchronisation and two independent AI pipelines.

## 🎨 UI Design System

### Header (48px slim bar)
The top navigation bar is a strict **3-zone layout**:

```
[ Logo ]  ←── [ Map | Filter | Language | Theme | Refresh ] ──→  [ Live Stats ]
```

- Every button has `hover:scale-110` with smooth easing
- Custom **Tip tooltip** component with arrow + fade-in animation
- Grouped buttons in pill containers with vertical dividers

### Visual Themes
All themes use CSS `filter` (hue-rotate + saturation + brightness) for a zero-overhead, instant colour transformation:

| Theme | Hue Shift | Mood |
|---|---|---|
| 🌙 Midnight | None | Default dark teal |
| 💚 Matrix | +35° | Cyberpunk lime |
| 🌅 Sunset | +165° | Warm amber gold |
| 🌊 Ocean | +200° | Cool sky blue |
| 💜 Purple | +260° | Deep violet |
| 🌸 Cherry | +320° | Rose pink |
| ❄️ Arctic | +185° desaturated | Ice white-blue |
| 🌲 Forest | +55° | Earthy olive |

### Sidebar
- Collapsed rail: shows avatar, leaderboard icon, quick stats, logout
- Expanded: profile card · last report card · leaderboard shortcut · impact stats · badge tier progression
- Toggle: `PanelLeftClose / PanelLeftOpen` icon embedded in the header row

## 🤖 AI Pipelines

### 1 — Cleanup Verification (`ai_review.py`)
1. Volunteer uploads an **"after"** photo.
2. Backend sends both before and after base64 images + location description to **Groq Vision** (`meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`).
3. Model returns structured JSON: `status` (approved / rejected), `confidence` (0.0–1.0), `summary`.
4. On approval → points awarded, marker turns cleaned (slate); on rejection → `verification-failed` status shown.

### 2 — Location Image Verification (`ai_review_location.py`)
1. When a citizen submits a report, the backend fetches a **Google Street View** static image for the GPS coordinates.
2. Both the citizen's uploaded photo and the Street View reference are sent to Groq Vision.
3. The model checks whether the uploaded photo plausibly matches the real-world location.
4. Result stored in `loc_verification_status` / `loc_verification_confidence` / `loc_verification_summary` columns.

## 🕹️ Demo Walkthrough

To see the full lifecycle, create **two accounts** — one Citizen and one Volunteer.

### Step 1 — Report (Citizen 👤)
1. Register / Login as **Citizen**
2. Click the **`+`** FAB (bottom-right)
3. Choose severity, drop a pin on the map, upload a before photo, add description + landmark
4. Submit — the marker broadcasts live to all connected users

### Step 2 — Clean Up (Volunteer 🧹)
1. Login as **Volunteer**
2. Click any reported marker → **"Claim for Cleanup"** (marker turns amber/pulsating)
3. After cleaning: click marker → **"Submit Proof"**, upload the after photo

### Step 3 — AI Verification 🤖
1. Groq Vision compares before & after photos
2. **Approved** → spot marked Cleaned, volunteer awarded points, leaderboard updates instantly
3. **Rejected** → status shows `verification-failed` with AI summary visible on the marker popup

### Step 4 — Explore the Map 🗺️
- Toggle **Heatmap View** (top-right on map) to see waste density
- Use the **Filter** dropdown in the header to isolate High / Active / Cleaned markers
- Switch **Visual Theme** from the palette icon in the header
- Click **Refresh** (↻) to pull the latest reports from the server
